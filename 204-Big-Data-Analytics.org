RSM
I suggest this flow:
1. Introduction to big data analytics (UNIT I)
    Included
2. HDFS (UNIT I)
    Included
3. Yarn (UNIT I)
    Included
4. Overview of Map-Reduce (UNIT I)
    Included
5. ETL, Data Formats - Tools like Talend (UNIT II)
         These topics are covered in Apache Flume.
6. Spark (UNIT III)
    Done
7. SparkML (UNIT IV)
     Unit IV  Kafka Streaming has been suggested by HOD
     SparkML is given in Unit V
8. Structured streaming in Spark (UNIT V)
     When comparing to spark streaming, kafka is simpler
