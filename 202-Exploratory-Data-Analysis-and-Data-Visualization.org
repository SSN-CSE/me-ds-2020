Add text book, Ref books, course objectives and outcomes
In unit - 3, visualization techniques for correlation and multivariate analysis are missing
In unit 4 avoid Tapping into the power of visual  perception -- Eloquence through simplicity
In unit 5 identify some case study / application; Avoid you/your - rewrite

1. The title, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization, is long. Consider shortening the title: Data Visualization.
   But the content should have Exploratory Data Analysis also.
