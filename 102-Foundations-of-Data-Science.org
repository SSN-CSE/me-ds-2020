The course outcome could be similar to the following and the contents can be tuned to this
Describe what Data Science is and the skill sets needed to be a data scientist. - Covered in Unit I Introduction 
Explain the signiﬁcance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in data science. Apply basic tools (plots, graphs, summary statistics) to carry out EDA. -- covered in Unit II and IV
Describe the Data Science Process and how its components interact.  - covered in Unit I
Apply EDA and the Data Science process in a case study. -- Covered in Unit II and Unit I
Apply basic machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), k-means, Naive Bayes) for predictive modeling. --Covered in Unit III

Identify common approaches used for Feature Generation.  -- We feel it is overloaded, kindly suggest the unit to include
Identify basic Feature Selection algorithms (Filters, Wrappers, Decision Trees, Random Forests) and use in applications.-- DT and RF are covered in unit III 
Create eﬀective visualization of given data using basic tools. -- covered in unit IV
Work eﬀectively in teams on data science projects.  -- Applications are given in unit V and lab


------

Is it a good idea to introduce data ethics?  -- included in Unit V

1. Consider the book: Doing Data Science -- Included in text books
2. Python should be covered in high level: lists, dictionaries, classes -- Basics can be covered in lab in order to python specific
3. NumPy (arrays), Scikit-Learn (ML algorithms), Pandas (data  table) should be covered for doing data anaylysis -- Covered in Unit I
4. Matplotlib should be introduced for visualization -- Covered in Unit IV

- 1. 
- 2. We checked other university courses relevant to this
- 3. Should we include Probabilty and statistics.
Randomness -- Empirical Distributions -- Testing Hypothesis -- Estimation --
Why the mean matters -- Prediction -- Inference for Regression.
